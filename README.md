## Bill of materials for the Dungeon project

The project
implements [Maven BOM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies)
which contains all common dependencies which are used in each part for the dungeon. It reduces the amount of dependencies which need to be added.

# Usage

## Import the BOM

You can always override a version managed by the BOM if the case requires it.
